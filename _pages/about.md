Hi, I am Guan-Horng Liu (I go by <b><i>&quot;Guan&quot;</i></b> ), a third-year Machine Learning PhD in Georgia Tech advised by
<!-- [Dr. Evangelos Theodorou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dG9MV7oAAAAJ&hl=en)  -->
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dG9MV7oAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Evangelos A. Theodorou</a>.
<!-- <a href="https://sites.gatech.edu/acds/" target="_blank">Autonomous Control and Decision Systems (ACDS)</a> -->


My research aims to
<u>
    develop a new paradigm of
    <strong>Deep Learning Optimization</strong> grounded on
    <strong>Optimal Control Theory</strong></u>.
This mathematical framework enables rich analysis from stochastic process, game theory, optimal transport, and information duality.
It also facilitates principled algorithmic design, better characterization of the training process, and architecture optimization.


I finished my M.S. in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University, working with
<a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/george-a-kantor/" target="_blank">George Kantor</a>
and
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mmv/" target="_blank">Manuela M. Veloso</a>
on off-road autonomous navigation and deep reinforcement learning. I also owned a B.S. in MechE at National Taiwan University, with an one-year research exchange at Tokyo Institute of Technology.

I worked in Uber Advanced Technology Group as a Robotics Autonomy Engineer for 1.5 years before joining Georgia Tech, developing motion planning algorithm for self-driving vehicles under the team led by
